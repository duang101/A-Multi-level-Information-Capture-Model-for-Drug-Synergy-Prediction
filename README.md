# A-Multi-level-Information-Capture-Model-for-Drug-Synergy-Prediction
MMSSyn is a multi-level information capture model for learning complex drug synergy mechanisms and improving synergistic drug combination prediction.
## Introducing
Synergistic drug combinations represent a promising strategy for enhancing cancer treatment efficacy. However, existing models struggle to effectively integrate heterogeneous data and capture complex interactions across system and molecular levels, limiting their predictive performance. To address this, we propose a multi-level information capture model (MMSSyn) capable of understanding drug synergy mechanisms through hierarchical information. First, we utilize a system relationship awareness module (SRAM) to capture system-level interaction patterns via modeling high-order associations between drugs and cell lines. Subsequently, a molecular substructure learning module (MSLM) refines molecular-level representations by learning informative substructure features, and a multi-level information fusion module (MIFM) is proposed to adaptively integrate features from both the system and molecular levels. MMSSyn achieves state-of-the-art Area Under Curve (AUC) scores of 97.9% on the Merck and 96.3% on the DrugComb benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization ability across datasets.
